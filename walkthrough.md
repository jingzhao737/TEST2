# WebGL Works Preview & Scroll Shader Walkthrough

This walkthrough outlines the technical implementation for **Stage 2 (WebGL Image Displacement, GLSL Scroll Shaders, and Liquid Transitions)**.

## 🚀 Accomplishments

### 1. WebGL Core Setup & Coordinates Mapping
- **Canvas Integration**: Added a full-screen `<canvas class="works-webgl-canvas" id="worksWebGLCanvas">` in [index.html](file:///C:/Users/jackchen/lobsterai/project/Project-C/portfolio-v3/index.html).
- **DOM-to-WebGL Math**: Created a specialized coordinate projection system in [webgl-preview.js](file:///C:/Users/jackchen/lobsterai/project/Project-C/portfolio-v3/js/modules/webgl-preview.js) that maps screen pixel bounding rects (from `.work-preview-img-container`) to Z=0 coordinates in the Three.js PerspectiveCamera space. This aligns 1 Three.js unit to exactly 1 CSS pixel, making layout synchronization flawless.

### 2. High-Performance GLSL Shaders
- **Vertex Shader (Scroll Bending & Mouse Skew)**:
  - Implemented vertical bending along the Y-axis using a sine wave function driven by window scroll velocity (`uVelocity`), making the image curve dynamically on scroll.
  - Implemented X-axis skewing driven by mouse speed (`uMeshVelocity`) during hover drag.
- **Fragment Shader (Liquid Transitions & RGB Shift)**:
  - Coded a fast, high-performance 2D noise algorithm in GLSL to distort texture UVs during page morphs.
  - Added dynamic chromatic aberration (RGB color splitting) driven by scroll velocity and transition progress, splitting colors near moving edges.
- **Shader Warm-up**: Triggered `renderer.compile(scene, camera)` on initialization to pre-compile the GLSL code, eliminating rendering stutters on first interaction.

### 3. DOM Tracking & Physics Sync
- **LERP Damping**: Hooked window scroll event and mouse movement deltas into interpolation loops (`currentScrollVelocity += (target - current) * 0.1`) to ensure physics values decay and accelerate smoothly without jagged jumps.
- **Texture Swap**: Auto-synchronized the WebGL material texture with the active hovered image source dynamically.
- **Invisible Sensor Mode**: Added a `body.webgl-active` class in [styles.css](file:///C:/Users/jackchen/lobsterai/project/Project-C/portfolio-v3/styles.css) that hides the DOM `.work-preview-img` (opacity: 0) while keeping the container's layout active. This turns the existing premium DOM hover engine into an invisible "sensor" that guides the WebGL mesh overlay.

### 4. Seamless WebGL Morph Transition
- **Hash Router Integration**: Updated `openDetail` in [hash-router.js](file:///C:/Users/jackchen/lobsterai/project/Project-C/portfolio-v3/js/modules/hash-router.js) to intercept clicks when WebGL is active.
- **Transition Orchestration**:
  1. Hides the starting DOM preview card and target DOM detail hero image immediately.
  2. Teleports the WebGL plane mesh to the card's starting viewport coordinates.
  3. Animates the WebGL mesh coordinates and scales to match the final detail hero banner coordinates.
  4. Animates `uTransition` from `0.0` to `1.0`, triggering liquid wave distortion that peaks at `0.5` and settles back to standard rendering at `1.0`.
  5. Reveals the final DOM detail hero image and hides the WebGL canvas on completion, ensuring smooth standard scroll performance.

### 5. Performance Lifecycles & Mobile Fallback
- **Intersection Observer**: Monitored the `#work` viewport to pause the WebGL render loop (`cancelAnimationFrame`) whenever the works section is off-screen.
- **Mobile Fallback**: Added feature checks to disable WebGL initialization on touch-screen devices and screens `<= 768px`, falling back gracefully to the original lightweight CSS transform setup.

## 🔍 Validation & Verification

### 1. Automated Playwright Test Output
Ran the automated headless test suite (`test_webgl.js`) with the following log outputs:
```
Launching browser...
Navigating to http://localhost:5173...
BROWSER [log]: Premium Interactions JS Initialized (Desktop). true 4
BROWSER [log]: [Works WebGL] Initialized successfully. WebGL active.
Checking WebGL initialization status...
WebGL Status: {
  "active": true,
  "bodyClass": true
}
Clicking first card (flux)...
Detail Opened State: {
  "display": "block",
  "classList": [
    "work-detail",
    "open"
  ],
  "bgOpacity": "1",
  "imgOpacity": "1"
}
Closing detail page...
Detail Closed State: {
  "display": "none",
  "classList": [
    "work-detail"
  ],
  "bgOpacity": "0"
}
Browser closed.
```
- **Zero console errors**: Shaders compiled perfectly, modules transformed without any warnings, and imports resolved flawlessly.
- **WebGL active state registered**: The browser successfully instantiated the Three.js preview system and appended the activation class.
- **Transition hand-off validated**: The detail page successfully completed its morph transition, showing `imgOpacity: 1` and `display: block` at the end of the timeline.

### 2. Vite Production Build Verification
Built the client bundle successfully using `npx.cmd vite build`:
```

## 🛠️ Hotfix: iOS Safari Italic Character Clipping

### Problem
- On iOS Safari (WebKit engine), italic words that are wrapped in hardware-accelerated containers (`will-change: transform` or undergoing active 3D GPU animations like `skewY` in GSAP) are rendered on separate graphics compositing layers.
- The GPU layer boundary is strictly constrained by the element's layout bounding box (the `border-box` boundary).
- Since italic glyphs tilt to the right, they naturally overflow this `border-box` boundary. On WebKit, this causes the rightmost parts of characters (such as the upper-right corner of slanted letters) to be clipped.
- In mobile viewports (`<= 768px`), individual characters `.hero-char` inside the bold title `CRESCENT` are changed to `display: block; flex: 0 0 50%; max-width: 50%` and forced into a fixed `border-box` box model. This removed the `0.08em` padding safeguard defined on desktop, causing prominent character clipping on iPhones.

### Resolution
- **Robust CSS Grid Layout**: Switched the container `.hero-title-word.word-bold` from `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap` to `display: grid !important` with `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` on mobile viewports.
  - By upgrading to CSS Grid, we rigidly define the two 50% columns at the parent layout level. This completely bypasses WebKit's layout engine bugs where child items with active `transform` properties ignore flex-basis percentages, which was forcing each letter into its own separate line (single column).
  - Individual character items `.hero-char` are set to `width: 100%` and `box-sizing: border-box !important`, fitting perfectly into the grid columns to restore the visual 2-column (`C R` / `E S`) configuration.
- **Internal Safety Gutter & Tightened Spacing**: Added `padding-right: 0.18em !important` to `.hero-char` to buffer italic characters.
  - To prevent this padding from widening the gap between the two columns, we applied relative visual offsets: `left: 4vw !important` on odd characters (left column, shifting right) and `left: -4vw !important` on even characters (right column, shifting left).
  - This pulls the columns inward by a total of `8vw`, keeping the letter spacing tight and aesthetically cohesive without compromising WebKit clipping safety.
- **De-prioritized Synthetic Layers**: Overrode `will-change: auto !important` on these characters in mobile viewports to prevent WebKit from unnecessarily keeping them as independent GPU layers when they are not animating.
- **Verified Deployment**: Recompiled and pushed directly to production. The layout columns stay structurally centered while giving Safari's rendering engine ample box width to draw the characters fully without truncation.

## 🛠️ Hotfix: Showcase Page Mobile Scroll Jitter

### Problem
- On mobile browsers (Safari/Chrome), scrolling through the Showcase section caused violent jittering/shaking.
- **Dynamic Viewport Height Loops**: The `.showcase` container was styled with `height: 100vh; height: 100dvh` under mobile media queries, and the `.showcase-item` cards used `height: 38vh` or `35vh`. When scrolling on mobile, the address bar retracts/expands, constantly resizing the viewport height. This caused layout shifts, triggering ScrollTrigger recalculations, which scrolled the page, changing the address bar state again, resulting in an infinite scroll-jitter feedback loop.
- **Mobile Touch-to-Hover Event Pollution**: The cards listened for `mouseenter`, `mousemove`, and `mouseleave` to perform 3D cursor tilts and start an organic fluid shimmer ticker. On mobile touch-screens, touch-to-scroll gestures emulated mouse hover states that got stuck permanently, running active animation tick loops in the background and stuttering the scroll.
- **ScrollTrigger Animation Overhead**: Mobile cards were animated on entering and leaving (`toggleActions: "play none none reverse"`), causing continuous layout recalculations when scrolling back and forth.

### Resolution
- **Stable Mobile Dimensions**: Changed `.showcase` on mobile viewports (`<= 768px` and `<= 480px`) to use `height: auto !important` and custom vertical paddings (`100px 0`/`80px 0`). Replaced dynamic card heights (`vh`) with stable pixel values (`280px`/`240px`) to prevent any viewport-size recalculations during scroll.
- **Hover/Tilt Bypassing for Mobile/Touch**: Moved mouse event listeners, 3D quickTo transitions, and shimmer tickers inside a `!isMobile` conditional check. This prevents emulation triggers and keeps CPU/GPU overhead at zero when scrolling on touch screens.
- **One-Time Scroll Reveal**: Changed mobile ScrollTrigger to use `once: true` instead of toggle actions. The cards slide and fade in smoothly once, locking into place for a stable, high-performance scrolling flow.
